# react-abstract-table
Abstract table to extend whatever way

The abstract table still needs below parts to make itself concrete. The table is flexible enough to accept independent implementation of the parts.

Rendering: You can use any kind of element or library to render like `<td>`, `<div>`, semantic-ui-react, bootstrap etc.

Data structure: The table needs data in some format to represent. Here you can define in any format.

Event handling: Any kind of event from any component can be fired and you can decide which level of rendering you need on that event.

State structure: You can decide which component should contain which kind of state to change that state from any events.
